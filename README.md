# Kindbot: Smart Home Gardening

Now that the cannabis industry is booming and prices are soaring, our goal is to make home growing more
accessible to the everyday grower. Kindbot packs an app, sensors, voice-control, and state-of-the-art computer vision to
eliminate guess work & maximize yields. Using custom object recognition models, Kindbot can diagnose potential problems
in the crop (ie. yellow flowers, over/under watering) and provide harvest predictions. For the novice without years of
experience, Kindbot helps provide domain knowledge to ensure a successful crop.
